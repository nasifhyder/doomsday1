Hi . Wassup !!?
Today it's gonna be a start of two new gaming episodes


1st one is MCVS [Modern Combat Versus]
2nd one is Minecraft [Pocket Edition]

It seems like you guys are enjoying MCVS and MINECRAFT along with PUBGM for a lot of time. 
And I have received a lot of suggestion for giving 'Life is strange' a chance(try). 
So decided to add 'life is strange' along with the others

1) PUBGM 
2) MCVS
3) MINECRAFT
4) Life Is Strange


Due to some issues like more videos pubgm then other games i am changing my youtube channels, 
i mean my second channel. you can still find my previous gameplays in this channel.Have a great time.
